First run initialize.m to assign values to various parameters, to produce a poisson stimuli, and to assign random initial weights.


Run observe whenever you want to see the output without changing the weights.(Set S=S1 or S2 stimulus accordingly)


Run ChangeWeightsRemoveSpikes to remove the output spikes.(Set S=S1 or S2 stimulus accordingly).


Run ChangeWeightsCauseSpikes to cause output spikes, if there are no spikes in the output.(Set S=S1 or S2 stimulus accordingly).
